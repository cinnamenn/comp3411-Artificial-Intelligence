Question1 (5 marks)

The dfs.py file contains a function called find_path . This functions takes six arguments: 

 neighbour_fn is a successor function and returns the set of all the neighbouring nodes.
start is the start node
goal : is the goal node
visited is the list of nodes which are already visited, explored along a path - cycle checking. 
The reachabl e function takes a tile as an argument and returns false if there is a wall on top of the tile or if the tile is outside of the grid map.
depth is the depth that your function should avoid searching at any deeper depth
Your task is to implement a function which returns a path between two nodes as a list of nodes using depth first search. If no path can be found, an empty list needs to be returned. 
Please only modify the marked section of the dfs.py file. The commented section of the file, TODO.

The DFSAgent class within the DFSAgent .py file then utilises your function to create a DFS agent. 
Please only modify the commented section of the file, TODO.

Question2 (5 marks) 

Your next task is to complete idDfsAgent class to create an IDDFS agent.

Most of the code is already implemented for you. Your only task is to complete the start_agent method using IDDFS to find the path between the two self.start and self.goa l nodes and assigns the path to the self.path variable. If no path can be found, an empty list needs to be returned.
